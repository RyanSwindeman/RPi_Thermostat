WARNING: NOT PRODUCTION-READY
To-Do list:
  - Buy smoke sensor and thermometer; build functions for data collection
  - Decide final relay hardware; verify relay functions work with hardware
  - QC temperature swing setting (recent addition)
  - More error and resilience testing (e.g. return from power outage)
  - HVAC connection and pin change in code
